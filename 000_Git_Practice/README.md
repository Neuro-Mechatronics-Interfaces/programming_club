# Git Practice #

This is a simple of a basic collaborative workflow using `git` to avoid conflicting changes during shared code development.  
In this example, you will:  
1. Clone a repo from GitHub to your computer.  
2. Create your own `dev/<initials>` branch.  
3. Request that your changes be merged back into the main branch.  

# Objective #  

You will add a word to the sentence under the next header, one word at a time, and using the GitHub `Pull Request` system we will play "once upon a time."  

## Add one word to this story ##
